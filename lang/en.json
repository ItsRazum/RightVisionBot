  "Messages_Greetings": "Greetings, {0}, and welcome to the main hub of RightVision23 - the largest gachi-event of this passing by year!\nYou can get the most relevant news about it, by accepting the newsletter, or you may send an application for participatiing in the competition!\n\nOfficial Telegram-group of RightVision: https://t.me/rightvision23",
  "Messages_About": "RightVision - it's just like EuroVision, but a RIGHT version of it, if you realize what I meanüòè.\n\nEvent includes 4 independent categories of member's skill: Bronze, Steel, Gold and Brilliant. As the person, who wants to participate, sends an application to become a member - our team RightVision instantly checks his skills in gachimaking and then places a member into one of these categories, that approximately matches member's skill. Fight for the winning in each of categories will take place separately - therefore, remix of the winner from the Gold category WILL NOT fight with the remixes from the Brilliant category!\n\nNow let's dive into the main structure of competition inside the category: Firstly there will be a live broadcast on our Youtube-channel, where audience and judges are going to listen to each gachiremix of this category (but it's gotta be only city stage yet), then you'll be able to vote for all the remixes you've listened to at our broadcast alongside with judges. Winner of voting will move on to a regional stage, where will happen the same broadcast and voting, and then - international stage, when the member will perform his own remix in standing up for his country. The winner of the country (international stage), that he's chosen to stand up for, will become a winner of the entire category, then the category will be closed due to the finishing of category competition\n\nAny questions? You may contact the RightVision team and ask something through me!",
